# Word-Guessing-Game

This Word Guessing Game is a Python project I created to demonstrate my coding skills. Players are tasked with guessing words from scrambled letters across three difficulty levels: easy, medium, and hard. Each round, they try to identify three target words, earning points for correct guesses. The game ends after three rounds, with the total score displayed.
I built this game to showcase my ability to create interactive, engaging applications. It reflects my skills in logic, string manipulation, and user interaction. Feel free to try it out and see how you stack up!
